# This is my Fabric 1.21.11 modpack for Minecraft

# What mods does it have?
I included some optimization mods as well as some QoL and visual mods.

# How to install?
You can install them by dragging mods and resourcepacks into Mineraft folders respectively.

# What settings do you use?
Its all up to you and your pc which settings should you use, but I like to use BSL with Minimal settings, render distance 16 chunks + voxy 256 chunks and no particles.
